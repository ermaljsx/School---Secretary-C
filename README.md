# School---Secretary-C
Simple student database management system, means the process of storing  the information of students in the computer. 
Normally this system is used in schools and  colleges to get the information of students and store it in the file. 
Information means student name, class,roll no or register no,performance,attendance, etc. 
To maintain  this data or information , all universities use their own database management software to maintain student records neatly without any problem. 
This is very useful and helpful to the schools and colleges, because these database management systems help  to maintain or store the records safely in the cloud or in their system.
The data in the  case of our project is saved in local files and every interactiion is done with this files.
